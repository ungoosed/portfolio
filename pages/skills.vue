            <TextCard color="#a2ed6f35" title="Origami" content="I've been folding origami most of my life. 
            My first major project was at the end of Grade 6 for my passion project, during the COVID19 pandemic. 
            I folded Satoshi Kamiya's Ancient Dragon, which took around 15 hours, including prep time to fold. 
            My latest project was designing my own original origami penguin.">

            <TextCard color="#fa9d6b75" title="Coding" content="I first learned programming in Grade 5 through Scratch, 
            a visual coding language geared towards beginners, where I created my first games.
            In Grade 7, I began messing around with HTML and Javascript, creating my first websites. 
            In 2023, I coded a video game about reproduction for Science 9/10. 
            I've involved myself in other self-driven projects including Minecraft mods, web development, and more video games.">

            <TextCard color="#fc383865" title="Juggling" content="My juggling journey began in the spring of 2022, where I first learned the 3 ball cascade. 
            I continued to practice infrequently until the winter of 2022, when I chose it as my skill activity for the Duke of Edinburgh Award. 
            Since then I have learned the Mill's Mess, the Shower, and various other tricks, including a 4 ball fountain.">
