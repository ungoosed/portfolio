        <TextCard title="STARS Reflection - Accomplishing" content="Throughout my entire life, I have always been learning. I've always wanted to know more, and took it upon myself to learn things like programming, origami, chess, and many other things. I've found that my unique gifts and talents are around reasoning, logic, and spatial thinking. I've also learned through my schoolwork, and I've taken my own time to learn more about some subjects and to make sure I fully understand the topic. I'm intending to continue developing these talents so that I can better serve the kingdom of God.">
