        <h2>STARS Reflection - Accomplishing</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout my entire    life, I have always been learning. I've always wanted to know more, and took it upon myself to learn things like programming, origami, chess, and many other things. 
            I've found that my unique gifts and talents are around reasoning, logic, and spatial thinking. 
            I've also learned through my schoolwork, and I've taken my own time to learn more about some subjects and to make sure I fully understand the topic. 
            I'm intending to continue developing these talents so that I can better serve the kingdom of God.

        <h2>VCS Community Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            The VCS community has always been very supportive. All the teachers and most of the students have been very friendly, always willing to help if I ask. They also celebrate successes with me, and encourage me through failures. I think that this community has helped to shape me into who I am today, teaching me to embody the VCS values of Seeking, Transforming, Accomplishing, Renewing, and Serving. I’ve learned to help others when they need help, to work hard to achieve my goals, and to work together as a team. I’ve also learned the importance of having people around you that you can rely on.
